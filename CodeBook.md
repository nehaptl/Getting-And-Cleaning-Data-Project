# Code Book for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Tidy Data 

The `tidy_data.txt` data file is a data set that has been merged, cleaned and filtered from a bigger and untidy data set which comprises of 3 sets and 8 files

### 3 sets of the data

1. The values of 'Activity' consist of data from 'y_train.txt' and 'y_test.txt'
1. The values of 'Subject' consist of data from 'subject_train.txt' and 'subject_test.txt'
1. The values of 'Features' consist of data from 'X_train.txt' and 'X_test.txt'


### 8 Files used for the data cleaning

- `X_train.txt`
- `X_test.txt`
- `y_train.txt`
- `y_test.txt`
- `subject_train.txt`
- `subject_test.txt`
- `activity_labels.txt`
- `features.txt`

The first row contains the Variable names, described in details under [Variables](#variables) section, and following rows are the values of these variables 

## Variables

## Data cleaning steps

The source data zip file is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The following work that was performed to clean up the Source data:

    1. The source data is downloaded and extracted from the zip file
    2. The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
    3. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
    4. The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names.
    5. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeBodyAccelerometer-Mean-X), using the following set of rules:
          - Special characters (i.e. (, ),) were removed
          - The initial f and t were expanded to frequency and time respectively.
          - Acc, Gyro, mag, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
          - Replaced BodyBody with Body.
    6. From the data set in step 5, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
